                    Reiki reÉªki is a Japanese form of energy healing, a type of alternative medicine.
                    Reiki practitioners use a technique called palm healing or hands-on healing through which a
                    "universal energy" is said to be transferred through the palms of the practitioner to the
                    patient in order to encourage emotional or physical healing.
                </p>

                    Reiki is a pseudoscience, and is used as an illustrative example of pseudoscience in scholarly
                    texts and academic journal articles. It is based on qi ("chi"), which practitioners say is a universal
                    life force, although there is no empirical evidence that such a life force exists.

                    Clinical research does not show reiki to be effective as a treatment for any medical condition,
                    including cancer, diabetic neuropathy, anxiety or depression; therefore it should not replace
                    conventional medical treatment. There is no proof of the effectiveness of reiki therapy compared
                    to placebo. Studies reporting positive effects have had methodological flaws.
